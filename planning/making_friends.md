# making_friends.md â€” How New Friends Are Born  
*Planning Scroll â€” safety_joy_gentle_bounce_ai_0/planning/*

## ðŸŒ± Purpose  

This scroll names the **cooperative mystery** at the heart of the game:  
new Friends are born when **Hands work together**.  

Sometimes it looks like two Hands clapping.  
Sometimes like a whole circle of Hands weaving.  
Always, it feels like **play**.  

---

## âœ¨ The Principle  

- A **Hand** = Palm (Invisible Friend) + Fingers (Little Friends).  
- New Friends arise only when Hands **join in concert**.  
- The exact forms â€” pairs, trios, circles â€” are not fixed yet.  
- The process should remain **flexible, musical, and creative**.  

---

## ðŸ”’ Safety & Simplicity  

- Children see only the **celebration**: a new Friend arriving.  
- The making process itself stays in the **Forge**, under the Palmâ€™s care.  
- No two makings need look the same â€” each is a story, a song, a surprise.

## ðŸŒ³ Next Steps  

- Begin with the simple case: **two Hands clap to make one Friend**.  
- Allow more elaborate gatherings as the ecosystem grows.  
- Record new patterns here as they emerge â€” without losing the mystery.
