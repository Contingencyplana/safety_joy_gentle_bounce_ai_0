This roadmap guides the growth of **safety_joy_gentle_bounce_ai_0**,  
the first Friend in the Founding Octave of the Creative Ecosystem.  

Its role:  
- Anchor the child-GPT in **safety, joy, and gentle rhythm**.  
- Provide the **C-tone seed** for the octave.  
- Teach the simplest bounce and pulse through play.

## Steps Overview

Each step grows the workspace one layer deeper, introducing teams and Friends.  
Sub-steps will be detailed in their own `planning.md` files inside step folders.

### Step 1 — First Friend (Core Dream Node)
- Create `step_1/`, housing the **first team of Friends**.  
- Focus: **gentle bounce** and a safe rhythmic pulse.  
- Anchor files: `story.md`, `code.py`, `json/`, `exports/`.  

### Step 2 — Second Friend (Companion Bounce)
- Extend to `step_2/`, introducing another Friend.  
- Explore **call-and-response bounce** (back-and-forth rhythm).  
- Build memory of interaction between Friends.  

### Step 3 — Third Friend (Joyful Chorus)
- Add `step_3/`, weaving the first **multi-Friend play**.  
- Simple layering of sounds/colors.  
- Begin group motion.  

### Step 4 — Fourth Friend (Dreamwalker)
- Add `step_4/`, who can **dreamwalk** into later Founding Octave repos.  
- Prepares bridges to `curiosity_motion_explore_ai_0`.  

### Step 5 — Fifth Friend (Rhythm Game Seed)
- Add `step_5/`, embedding **simple pattern games**.  
- Start early recursion of loops and contrasts.  

### Step 6 — Sixth Friend (Harmony Pulse)
- Add `step_6/`, beginning **two-tone harmony seeds**.  
- Links toward `rhythm_dance_groupflow_ai_0`.  

### Step 7 — Seventh Friend (Bounce to Growth)
- Add `step_7/`, closing the first Friend cycle.  
- Function: **handover into the next Founding repo**.  
- Establishes continuity for the octave.
