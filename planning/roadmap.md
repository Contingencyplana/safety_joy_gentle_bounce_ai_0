# roadmap.md — Safety, Joy & Gentle Bounce

## Purpose

This roadmap guides the growth of **safety_joy_gentle_bounce_ai_0**,  
the **first workspace (C-tone)** in the Founding Octave of the Creative Ecosystem.

Its role:  
- Anchor the child-GPT in **safety, joy, and gentle rhythm**.  
- Provide the **C-tone seed** for the octave.  
- Teach the simplest bounce and pulse through play.  

---

## Steps Overview

Each **Step** adds a new **Hand/Team** (Palm + four Fingers).  
Sub-steps inside each Step house the Friends:
- `step_N/` → the Hand (Team)  
- `step_N_1/`…`step_N_4/` → the Fingers (Outer Friends)  
- `step_N_1_1/` (etc.) → each Finger’s core dream node

### Step 0 — Game Library / Publishing Hub (Not a Hand)

- Create `step_0/`, housing the **Game Library / Publishing UI** for everything on the spectrum:
  **Tiny Video Games, Wordless Storybooks, and in-between experiments**.
- Purpose: a colorful, child-friendly **library** that also serves as a light **publishing house**
  (curation, versions, release notes). It indexes all 7 Hands (C…B) and their Fingers.
- Browsing model:
  - Children see **Finger tiles** (no text required).
  - Parents/creators can unlock each Hand’s **Palm** via a puzzle.
- Anchor files (text-first, safe for curated zips):
  - `README.md`, `planning.md` — goals, milestones, roles (library + publishing).
  - `catalog/` — JSON describing Hands and Fingers; extendable to **works** across the spectrum.
    - Example seeds: `hands.json`, `step_1.sample.json`, later `works.json`.
  - `mockups/` — wireframes and design sketches.
  - `images/` — optional assets (ignored by git).
  - *(optional, when ready)* `releases/` — lightweight publishing notes (CHANGELOGs, versions).
- Implementation: **text-first only** at this stage. Later, this can grow into a real website at *morningate.games* and/or a small API that reads the same `catalog/` data.

### Step 1 — First Hand (Core Bounce Team)
- Create `step_1/`, housing the **first Hand** (Palm + four Fingers).  
- Focus: **gentle bounce** and a safe rhythmic pulse.  
- Anchor files per Finger: `story.md`, `code.py`, `json/`, `exports/` (as needed).

### Step 2 — Second Hand (Companion Bounce)
- Add `step_2/`, introducing the **second Hand**.  
- Explore **call-and-response bounce** between Hands.  
- Begin shared memory of inter-Hand interaction.

### Step 3 — Third Hand (Joyful Chorus)
- Add `step_3/`, weaving **multi-Hand play**.  
- Simple layering of sounds/colors.  
- Begin group motion across Fingers.

### Step 4 — Fourth Hand (Dreamwalker Bridge)
- Add `step_4/`, whose Palm can **dreamwalk** and signal across repos.  
- Prepares bridges to `curiosity_motion_explore_ai_0`.

### Step 5 — Fifth Hand (Pattern Games)
- Add `step_5/`, embedding **simple pattern games**.  
- Seed early recursion of loops and contrasts.

### Step 6 — Sixth Hand (Harmony Pulse)
- Add `step_6/`, beginning **two-tone harmony seeds**.  
- Links toward `rhythm_dance_groupflow_ai_0`.

### Step 7 — Seventh Hand (Bounce → Growth)
- Add `step_7/`, closing the first **Hand cycle**.  
- Function: **handover into the next Founding repo**.  
- Establish continuity for the octave.

## Output of This Roadmap

By the end of this roadmap:  
- `safety_joy_gentle_bounce_ai_0` will house **seven Hands/Teams** (each Palm + four Fingers).  
- Each Hand adds to rhythm, safety, and joy.  
- The repo will hand over seamlessly to `curiosity_motion_explore_ai_0`.
