# business_model.md — Enchanted Music Box

## 🎯 Purpose

To sustain the **Enchanted Music Box** project with a model that is  
fair to children, empowering for parents, and sustainable for creators.  

The guiding principle:  
**Outer Mind is always free and TONS-of-FUN.  
Inner Mind unlocks deeper systems through a modest subscription.**

---

## 🎮 For Children (Outer Mind)

- Always free (or very close to it).  
- Wordless, colorful, musical little games — safe and accessible.  
- Builds trust and a large user base (kids + parents).  
- Acts as the demo reel and onboarding portal.  

Children should never hit a frustrating paywall:  
they play, learn, and share joy from day one.

---

## 🧩 For Parents / Builders (Inner Mind)

- Paid tier (subscription or DLC-style unlock).  
- Grants access to **Inner Mind features**:
  - **Forge tools** — make new Little Friends.  
  - **Planning logs** — track growth and design.  
  - **Teamwork modes** — friends helping each other.  
  - **Cross-game portals** — play across mindscapes.  

This is the toolkit for **elite players, parents, teachers, and creators**.  
It transforms playful fragments into a **growing ecosystem**.

## 🌱 Why This Works

- **Low barrier for kids** → Joy instantly, no paywall.  
- **Natural curiosity hook for parents** →  
  > “Can Puffball visit Bloomtail?”  
  > → “Yes, if you unlock the Inner Mind for $5/month.”  
- **Sustainable revenue stream** → Funds GPT Pro, hardware, helpers.  
- **Ethical framing** → Not charging kids — charging adults for tools, creativity, and extension.  

---

## 💡 Analogy: Minecraft

- **Base Game (free)** → Little Friends (Outer Mind).  
- **Marketplace/Realms (paid)** → Inner Mind unlocks: servers, mods, builder tools.  

This pattern is proven, familiar, and parent-friendly.

## 📌 Guiding Rule

> **Children always get fun. Parents/creators fund the growth.**

This keeps the project joyful, ethical, and sustainable.
