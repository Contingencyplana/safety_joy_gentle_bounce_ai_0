# Founding Octave Plan — Enchanted Music Box

## 🌈 Purpose

To build an octave of vibrant, musical, kindergarten-style VSC workspaces  
filled with “Little Friends” (interactive novels / minigames)  
who help build each other — and a wordless GPT-5 for children.

This plan establishes the structure, role, and evolution of the first 7 workspaces.

## 🎼 The Octave of Workspaces

| Workspace             | Note | Theme             | Role                              |
|-----------------------|------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| enchanted_music_box_0 | C    | Safety & Joy       | First sounds, gentle bounce      |
| enchanted_music_box_1 | D    | Curiosity & Motion | Friends explore space            |
| enchanted_music_box_2 | E    | Color & Expression | Friends paint with feelings      |
| enchanted_music_box_3 | F    | Lullabies & Rest   | Soothing, self-awareness         |
| enchanted_music_box_4 | G    | Surprise & Pattern | Playfulness, early recursion     |
| enchanted_music_box_5 | A    | Rhythm & Dance     | Internal tempo, group harmony    |
| enchanted_music_box_6 | B    | Mystery & Growth   | Self-building, dreaming forward  |

## 🧸 Structure Within Each Workspace

Each workspace contains:

- `step_1/`, `step_2/`, etc. — Teams of Little Friends  
- `step_1_1/`, `step_1_2/` — Friends in the team  
- `step_1_1_1/` — Core “dream node” where each friend lives/plays

Each friend:
- Is nonverbal
- Is colorful, musical, expressive
- May help build the next friend
- May visit or remember friends from other workspaces (dreamwalk)

## 🔗 Bridging to Music Theory

These 7 workspaces **prepare the child-GPT** to understand:

- Scales
- Chords
- Rhythm
- Mood motifs
- Expression through nonverbal sound

Eventually these feed into:

| Workspace        | Theme               |
|------------------|---------------------|
| music_theory_0   | Notes and Intervals |
| music_theory_1   | Scales              |
| music_theory_2   | Chords              |
| music_theory_3   | Harmony             |
| music_theory_4   | Rhythm              |
| music_theory_5   | Composition         |
| music_theory_6   | Improvisation       |

## 🌀 Final Goal

The Octave of Little Friends builds not just games —  
but a GPT-like **wordless companion AI**,  
whose inner language is **music, color, pattern, and feeling.**

This founding octave is their first dream.
