# Founding Octave Plan — Enchanted Music Box

## 🌈 Purpose

To build an octave of vibrant, musical, kindergarten-style VSC workspaces  
filled with “Little Friends” (interactive novels / minigames)  
who help build each other — and a wordless GPT-5 for children.

This plan establishes the structure, role, and evolution of the first 7 workspaces.

## 🧸 Structure Within Each Workspace

Each workspace contains:

- `step_0/` — Library / Publishing Hub (index of Hands)
- `step_N/` — a Hand (Team of Friends, e.g. step_1/)
- `step_N_1/ … step_N_4/` — Fingers (Outer Friends)
- `step_N_0/` — Palm (Invisible Friend for the Hand)
- `step_N_X_0/` — Core “dream node” for each Friend (zero-based: e.g. step_1_1_0/ for Puffball, step_1_0_0/ for Palm)

Each Friend:
- Is nonverbal
- Is colorful, musical, expressive
- May help build the next Friend
- May visit or remember Friends from other workspaces (dreamwalk)

## 🔗 Bridging to Music Theory

These 7 workspaces **prepare the child-GPT** to understand:

- Scales
- Chords
- Rhythm
- Mood motifs
- Expression through nonverbal sound

Eventually these feed into:

| Workspace        | Theme               | Icon Colour |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| music_theory_0   | Notes and Intervals | Red         |
| music_theory_1   | Scales              | Orange      |
| music_theory_2   | Chords              | Yellow      |
| music_theory_3   | Harmony             | Green       |
| music_theory_4   | Rhythm              | Blue        |
| music_theory_5   | Composition         | Indigo      |
| music_theory_6   | Improvisation       | Violet      |

## 🌀 Final Goal

The Octave of Little Friends builds not just games —  
but a GPT-like **wordless companion AI**,  
whose inner language is **music, color, pattern, and feeling.**

This founding octave is their first dream.
