# planning_as_play.md — Turning Planning Into Play

## 🌱 Purpose

This scroll reminds us that **planning is not chores** —  
it is part of the **gameplay itself**.  
Every roadmap, milestone, and structure file should feel like  
a questline, a puzzle, or a song, not dry project management.

## 🎮 Mechanics of Planning-as-Play

- **Milestones → Songs**  
  The Invisible Friend can “sing” completed milestones back as progress chants.  

- **Roadmaps → Questlines**  
  `roadmap.md` doubles as a band itinerary: each step feels like a stage to unlock.  

- **Team Structures → Scrolls**  
  `team_structure.md` is presented as a magical scroll of how the band is formed.  

- **Forge Recipes → Planning Steps**  
  Inner Mind planning can surface as forge recipes:  
  *“To make Bloomtail’s next upgrade, gather 3 rhythm seeds and 1 color spark.”*  

---

## ✨ Examples

- `milestones.md` could rhyme, or be sung aloud by the game narrator.  
- `README.md` is framed as a **Lore Scroll**, telling newcomers why the friend exists.  
- `planning.md` could offer choices:  
  *“Should Puffball bounce higher (Rhythm), or shine brighter (Color) next?”*

## 🔒 Safety Principle

- Children always experience planning in playful, safe, non-textual ways.  
- Parents/creators unlock the deeper planning scrolls (full text) in the Invisible Friend’s domain.

*This stub sets the pattern.  
As each Friend grows, enrich this file with concrete examples of how planning and play merge.*
