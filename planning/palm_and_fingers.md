# palm_and_fingers.md — The Hand Metaphor for Little Friends  
*Planning Scroll — safety_joy_gentle_bounce_ai_0/planning/*

---

## 🌱 Purpose

This scroll defines the **Hand Metaphor**:  
- **Palm** = Invisible Friend (Inner Mind, Team Leader).  
- **Fingers** = Little Friends (Outer Mind, four child-facing games).  

The metaphor ensures every team acts as a **unified hand** —  
always entering, playing, and leaving together.

## ✋ The Palm and Fingers

### Palm (Invisible Friend)
- Holds the **Forge, schemas, orchestration logic**.  
- Delegates tasks to Finger-controllers.  
- Approves updates and ensures safety.  
- Can “shake hands” with other Palms (team-to-team play).  

### Fingers (Outer Friends)
- Each is a **wordless, colorful, musical game**.  
- Child-facing: storybooks or tiny video games.  
- Safe public files only (`story.md`, `assets/`, `config.public.json`).  
- Playful in isolation, but strongest when guided by the Palm.  

---

## 🎮 Group Entry and Exit Rule

- A **team always enters, plays, and exits as a unit**.  
- No solo wandering: if Puffball plays in Rippleleaf’s dream,  
  the whole hand is present, even if one Finger “gestures” more visibly.  
- This keeps the sense of **safety, teamwork, and belonging** consistent.

## 🤝 Making New Friends
Hands may also join in making new Friends — see **planning/making_friends.md**.

---

## 🌿 Future Extensions

- **Handshake mode**: Palms coordinate so two bands of Friends  
  can play together without chaos.  
- **Gestures**: a Finger can act as spokesperson (e.g.,  
  Melodybug leads a tune), but still tethered to its Palm.

## 🔒 Safety & Simplicity

- Children only see **Fingers**; the Palm remains optional/hidden.  
- Parents/creators unlock Palm functions with a gatekeeping puzzle.  
- Planning, Forge, and orchestration are always Palm-side.
