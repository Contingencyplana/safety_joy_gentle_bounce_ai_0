## üå± Purpose

This scroll gathers the **seven lenses** through which we understand  
the nature of Little Friends (Outer) and Invisible Friends (Inner).  

Each lens is a way of seeing ‚Äî a seed for future doctrine scrolls.  
Some will remain short; others may one day branch into their own files.

## 1. Wordless Interactive Storybooks  
- Gentle, page-like scenes that unfold with swipes/taps.  
- A ‚Äústorybook without text‚Äù ‚Äî music, color, and motion tell the tale.  
- Designed for **very young children**: slow, calm, exploratory.  
- Example keys in `config.public.json`: `"mode": "storybook"`, `"page_count": 8`.  

---

## 2. Tiny Video Games  
- Replayable mechanics: bounce, loop, match, rhythm, balance.  
- Still wordless, but more **game-like in feedback**.  
- Ideal for short, joyful bursts of play.  
- Example keys in `config.public.json`: `"mode": "game"`, `"session_target_s": 90`.  

---

## 3. Little Friends and Invisible Friends  
- Every visible **Outer Friend** is paired with an **Invisible Friend**.  
- Outer = play surface (children).  
- Inner = forge, planning, orchestration (parents/creators).  
- Together they form a **dynamic duo**: playful whole + guiding hand.  

---

## 4. Outcrowd and Incrowd  
- **Outcrowd** = Outer Friends: colorful, musical, simple, public.  
- **Incrowd** = Invisible Friend + makers: schemas, code, forge, exports.  
- Both matter ‚Äî the Outcrowd builds trust; the Incrowd builds depth.  

---

## 5. Musical Dream Seeds  
- Each Friend is also a **musical seed** ‚Äî rhythm, tone, harmony, motif.  
- Growth = layering seeds into songs, teams, bands, ecosystems.  
- Example: Puffball = C-tone bounce, Melodybug = melodic motif.  

---

## 6. On the Spectrum  
- Friends fall along a spectrum:  
  - Some lean more **storybook** (narrative, calm).  
  - Some lean more **game** (mechanics, replay).  
- All remain **wordless, safe, and musical** ‚Äî just tilted in tone.  

---

## 7. TONS-of-FUN Mechanics  
- The core invariant: play must always be **delightful**.  
- No fail states; only gentle feedback and celebration.  
- Example mechanics: bounce, catch, loop, layer, echo, mirror.  
- Eventually ‚Üí a catalog of ‚Äúdesign patterns for joy.‚Äù

## üå≥ Next Steps  
- Begin by tagging each Friend with its **primary lens** (storybook/game).  
- Use this scroll as the root reference; when a section deepens,  
  split it into its own file (e.g., `tons_of_fun_mechanics.md`).
