# Step 0 Planning — Library UI

Goals
- Show 7 Hands grouped by tone (C…B), each with 4 Finger tiles.
- Soft color palette, big tappable tiles, zero text required for kids.
- Parent/creator unlock → Palm.

Data Contract (text-first)
- `catalog/hands.json` lists Hands (id, name, tone, colors).
- `catalog/step_1.sample.json` shows one Hand’s Fingers (ids, names, emoji/color).

Milestones
- M0: Static catalog files present.
- M1: Wireframe mockup describes layout & states (locked/unlocked).
- M2: Hand tiles reflect tones/colors consistently with planning scrolls.
