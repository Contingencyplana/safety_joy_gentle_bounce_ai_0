# Architecture Overview — safety_joy_gentle_bounce_ai_0

- **Hand Metaphor**: Palm (Invisible Friend, team leader) + Fingers (Outer Friends, wordless books/games).
- **Planning Scrolls**: absorbed later into gameplay.
- **Ops Scripts**: `make_zips.ps1` for reproducible zips.
- **Folders**:  
  - `planning/` — lore + structure  
  - `docs/` — reference (non-lore)  
  - `dist/` — build outputs  
  - `json/`, `tests/`, `exports/` — future runtime, checks, and child-facing builds.
