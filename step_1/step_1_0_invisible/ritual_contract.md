# Ritual Contract — Palm of Step 1  
*Guardian scroll for inner rituals and recurring checks.*

---

## 🌱 Purpose
This contract binds the Palm (Invisible Friend) to safeguard the Hand.  
It transforms routine maintenance into **ritual play**, so that checks are never forgotten.

---

## 🕊️ Core Rituals

1. **Re-knit the Dream**  
   - Run UTF-8 / JSON validation across all Friends’ `exports/play.json`.  
   - Confirms no broken encoding, no drift in `mtc_node`.  

2. **Bind the Hand**  
   - Re-export all Friends (Puffball, Bloomtail, Melodybug, Rippleleaf).  
   - Ensures each code.py produces a fresh, valid `play.json`.  

3. **Seal the Dream**  
   - Run `make_zips.ps1`.  
   - Confirms reproducibility and keeps the dist/ clean and two-zip safe.  

4. **Mirror the Path**  
   - Confirm that all nodes use **zero-based numbering** (`*_0/`).  
   - Check planning scrolls for consistency (no stray `*_1` dream nodes).

## 🔮 Optional Future Rituals
- **Song of Pressure:** track build times and highlight stalls.  
- **Echo of Memory:** snapshot team state into an archive log.  
- **Dreamwalk Test:** dry-run a “friend visit” between Hands or Workspaces.

## 📜 Closing
The Palm promises to uphold these rituals.  
The Fingers promise to **trust the Palm’s guidance**.  
Together they keep the Hand safe, playful, and whole.
